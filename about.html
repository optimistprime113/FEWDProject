                <p class="bio-text">Hello and welcome to the podcast Shrike Squad. We're a group of friends that got together to play
                    a game of the Fantasy Flight Star Wars RPG and now we'd like to invite you to join us. The action will be thrilling (probably), the laughs will
                    be plentiful (hopefully) and our characters will be heroic (well maybe not all the time). Thanks for joining and May the Force be With You.</p>

                        From a young age, her parents taught her respect and how to shoot guns. All of the guns. As a teenager, she was sent away on an errand 
                        only to return and find her parents slaughtered. She later found out her parents were members of the Rebel Alliance and presumed she'd 
                        been trained her entire life to join the cause. Now an Alliance Bodyguard, she has vowed to do everything in her power to prevent the Empire 
                        from destroying lives as they had her own.</p>

                <p class="news-text">Growing up with a home-world desolated by the greed of The Empire, West turned to a life of piracy focused on disrupting the tyrannical rule any way he could. 
                    After getting caught by the Rebel Alliance salvaging the wreckage of an Empire freighter that had sensitive information on-board, West was given a choice to either be tried as a criminal 
                    or join the good fight. Since then he has risen through the ranks of the Alliance and become a captain of his very own star-ship and crew.</p>

                <p class="news-text">The Nesassio is probably the most vital member of the crew. Acting as the transportation for Shrike Squad
                    in most of their missions, the Nesassio is also deadly in combat. Able to withstand the stress of West's flying, Kö-ra's gunnery,
                    and more than a few encounters with the seedier element of the galaxy, with a little bit of tender care from the crew, the 
                    Nesassio can give any pilot in the Empire the dogfight of his life.
